# AlphaTama

AlphaTama is an in-progress AlphaZero implementation for the game Onitama in Go.
The project is based on [agogo by Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/agogo).

The Game is not yet implemented, there's still a lot of groundwork to be laid.
For a complete (albeit weak) implementation, see the precursor, [Gonitama](https://github.com/Swiddis/Gonitama).
