# AlphaTama

AlphaTama is an in-progress AlphaZero implementation for the game Onitama in Go.
The project is based on [agogo by Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/agogo).

The Game is not yet implemented, there's still a lot of groundwork to be laid.
For a complete (albeit weak) implementation, see the precursor, [Gonitama](https://github.com/Swiddis/Gonitama). There's also a rather strong [bot by Max Bennedich](https://github.com/maxbennedich/onitama).

This one is unlikely to work in the near future because I can't seem to get Agogo to work, but I'll keep messing with it on occasion.
